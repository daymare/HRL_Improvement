Implement eigensolving with the Lanczos method from scipy. Will take solving eigenvalues from O(n^3) to O(n) which will allow us to work with larger transition graphs.



consider changing parittions from a strictly positive parittion to a positive and a negative partition, may allow for the creation of more classes of partition which we may need for maxq.
To create subtasks we may need positive, negative, and neutral partitions. for goal states, failure states, and active states.
